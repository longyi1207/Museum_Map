This is a team project implemented in DeisHack 2022 for Charles River Museum, a nonprofit organization .
Charles River Museum is currently closed due to the pandemic and will reopen in April 2022. Therefore, we design a event on the Easter Day alike scavenger hunt to attract vistors.

Specifically, vistors can scan QRcode under some of the exhibits, answer a question related to the exhibits, and earn a virtual egg. After collecting a number of eggs, users can play a spinwheel and win a prize, including museum key chains, nearby restaurants' coupons etc.

Our team created a website as the user interface for this event, containing a virtual map, record of eggs vistors collected, and the question and spinwheel pages. 
We also implement APIs that museum staff can easily use to generate eggs, qrcodes, and create similiar activities without technical background. We mainly used node.js and ruby on rails.
